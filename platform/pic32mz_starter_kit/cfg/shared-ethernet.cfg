/* 
 * This is a configuration sample for two VMs sharing the Ethernet driver. 
 * 
 * Using the PIC32MZ Ethernet Shared driver is possible to share the Ethernet
 * device among different VMs. Each VM will have its own MAC address and IP address. 
 * To use/test it, you need to have the picoTCP stack running in multiple VMs. 
 * To this, follow the steps:
 * 
 * 1 - Duplicate the directory bare-metal-apps/apps/tcp-listener to tcp-listener2.
 * 2 - Inside the tcp-listener2 directory rename the file tcp-listener.c to tcp-listener2.c.
 * 3 - In the file tcp-listener2.c modify the IP address 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.3.
 * 4 - Use the shared-ethernet.cfg file to generete the firmware. 
 * 5 - Enable the flag CONFIG_PIC32MZ_ETHERNET_SHARED_DRV in the main Makefile.
 * 
 * If you desire more VMs sharing the Ethernet device repeate the steps above and
 * increase the NUMBER_OF_VM defined bellow. 
 
 *
 * To compile this example, modify the variable CFG_FILE on the 
 * Makefile to point to this file.
